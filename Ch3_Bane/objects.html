	<h1>Foundations of Web Design</h1>
	<h2>Objects: Images</h2>
	<p>When you want to add images to a website, you can use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. Here are some of the different formats you can use:</p>
	<h3>JPG:</h3>
	<p>Good for photographs and artwork that has gradients</p>
	<!-- place JPG sample here -->
	<h3>PNG:</h3> 
	<h4>PNG-24</h4>
		<p>Good for photos and illustrations that have a transparent background</p>
	<!-- place PNG 24 sample here -->
	<h4>PNG-8</h4> 
	<p>Format for flat-color images that don't require transparency and have no gradients. While GIFs were once used, PNG-8 gives us a smaller file size.</p>
	<!-- place PNG 8 sample here -->
	<h3>SVG:</h3> 
	<p>Also great for icons or any illustration created in a vector applications, but these images can scale without losing quality.</p>
	<!-- place SVG sample here -->
	<h2>Objects: Videos</h2>
	<p>Adding videos to your site can be easy or complex. For our example, we're going to stick with the basics and bring in a video hosted on YouTube. You can sign up for you own free account, upload videos, and allow then embed those videos on your own website.</p>
	<!-- place YouTube sample here -->
